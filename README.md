Title of the Project: DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF CYBER ATTACK IN NETWORKING USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS
Technologies:-Python and Machine Learning Algorithms,Web Technologies(HTML,CSS)
Description:
– The Main Agenda of this project is to identify and detect whether the dataset to be attacked or not.
– For that purpose , i'm using Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) provided by
   Machine Learning Techniques.
– This Machine learning algorithms will be used to detect whether the request data contain normal or attacked (anomaly)
  signatures.
– SVM and ANN are used to detect the Cyber Attack based on the predicting their accuracy.
– Finally, the accuracy was represented in the Accuracy Graph where i have concluded that ANN got better accuracy rate
  compare to SVM.
